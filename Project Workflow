ðŸ”„ Workflow: Step-by-Step Process of the Code

Initialization:

Serial communication starts at 9600 baud for debugging.

Pulse sensor pin is set as input; Heart LED pin as output.

OLED display is initialized using Adafruit_SH1106G.

"Initializing..." message is shown on the screen.

Initial "BPM: " label is printed on the OLED.

Main Loop Begins:

The analog signal from the pulse sensor is read from A0.

A smoothing algorithm is applied to stabilize the signal (weighted average).

Pulse Detection and BPM Calculation:

When the smoothed signal crosses the threshold and no pulse was recently detected:

Current time is captured.

IBI (Inter-Beat Interval) is calculated as the time between beats.

BPM is computed as 60000 divided by IBI.

BPM is printed on Serial Monitor and updated on the OLED.

Waveform scroll speed (waveInterval) and LED blink timing (blinkDelay) are adjusted based on BPM.

Heart LED is turned ON.

Pulse detection flag is set to true.

Pulse End Detection:

When the signal drops below the threshold minus a margin (30), pulseDetected is reset to false to detect the next beat.

LED Blink Control (non-blocking):

The LED remains ON for a duration defined by blinkDelay.

After the delay, LED is turned OFF, and blink state is reset.

Waveform Drawing:

At intervals based on waveInterval, a pixel is drawn representing the current pulse value.

Y-position is mapped from signal strength to fit within the waveform area.

xPos moves horizontally, wrapping around when reaching the screen edge.

When the screen is full, the waveform area is cleared and reset for continuous scrolling.

Loop repeats indefinitely, updating display and LED feedback in real time as new pulse data is received.
